## <h2> Overview of FinTech Company


* The full name is **Sofi Technologies**

* The company was incorporated back in 2011 as Social Finance Inc and it was offering student loan refinancing. SoFi went public through a SPAC (special purpose acusion company) merger in 2021 and changed its name to SoFi Technologies in May 2021.

* Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finniganand Ian BradyWho are the founders of the company.

* The idea of the company is to could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a pilot at Stanford.

* Funds:
    * In September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million, led by Baseline Ventures, with participation from DCM and Renren. Additional investors included Ron Suber.
    * On October 2, 2013, SoFi announced that it had raised $500 million in debt and equity to fund and refinance student loans. This total funding amount came from $90 million in equity, $151 million in debt, and $200 million in bank participations, with the remaining capital from alumni and community investors.
    * The $151 million in debt includes a $60 million line of credit from Morgan Stanley, and a $41 million line of credit from Bancorp.
    * As of September 2013, SoFi had funded $200 million in loans to 2500 borrowers at the company's 100 eligible schools.
    * In November 2013, SoFi announced a deal with Barclays and Morgan Stanley to create a bond backed by peer-to-peer student loans, which would create the first securitization of these loans to receive a credit rating.
    * In April 2014, SoFi raised $80 million in a Series C round led by Discovery Capital Management with participation from Peter Thiel, Wicklow Capital, and existing investors. 
    * In February 2015, the company announced a $200 million funding round led by Third Point Management.
    * The firm also raised a $1 billion round of investment from SoftBank.
    * In February 2017, it was announced that Social Finance Inc. raised an additional $500 million from an investor group led by Silver Lake, and also including SoftBank, to help support global expansion.
    * In May 2019, SoFi closed $500 million in a single funding round led by Qatar Investment Authority.
* Financial perfomance:
SoFi is a recent company and therefore is still in an early-growth phase and has naturally reported losses throughout recent years. In 2021, its net loss was close to $490 million, more than double compared to 2020. Its adjusted revenue was slightly above $1 billion, more than double from 2019, showing that SoFi's top-line is growing quite rapidly. From an operating perspective, SoFi also reported losses in the past year (including stock-based compensation) and this is not expected to reverse anytime soon, considering that SoFi's guidance for 2022 is to generate some $1.57 billion in revenues, but EBITDA should be negative by around $160 million. At this stage, this is not particularly an issue but one of SoFi's main challenges is to continue to grow its business, but at the same time reach a level of scale that will enable it to achieve breakeven.

## <h2> Business Activities:

* Specific:
    * SoFi's approach has been to be a one-stop-shop for its customers, offering a vast array of financial products including loans, savings, investments, and insurance, beyond others.
    * According to SoFi, its business is built around its members' needs operating as a member-oriented one-stop-shop for financial services, being this the main competitive differentiator to other financial services providers. For instance, its customer service is available 24x7, a key differentiator compared to the traditional financial service availability based on 9-5 Monday through Friday.
    * This means that SoFi's strategy is to build a strong and lasting customer relationship, and with time offering a higher number of products to its customers. This enables it to increase the value and revenue generated from each customer without the cost of acquisition of an additional customer, improving its economies of scale and business profitability.

* Customers target is 25 to 40-year old professionals who are ignored by traditional wealth managers and often stuck with high minimums if they want the advice of a professional.
SoFi has a solid track record, particularly over the past couple of years, in which the number of its members (customers) has increased significantly. It reached more than 3.4 million at the end of 2021.

* Usually, fintechs specialize in specific fields or financial products, like checks, savings accounts, or stock brokerage, but SoFi's approach has been to be a one-stop-shop for its customers, offering a vast array of financial products including loans, savings, investments, and insurance, beyond others. This business model puts SoFi in direct competition with other neobanks, such as Chime, but also to traditional banks like JPMorgan 

* Technologies:
    - SoFi has a vertically-integrated technology platforms supporting its operations, to offer a better service to its members and differentiate itself from competitors. SoFi's business is segmented into three operating units:
        * Lending
        * Technology Platform
        * Financial Services
    - *Lending* is related to student loans, home and personal loans.
    - *Technology Platform* consists of Galileo, which it acquired in 2020. Galileo is a provider of technology platform services for financial and non-financial institutions.
    - *Financial Services* segment includes cash management and investment services.
    
    - The development of in-house technological capabilities is part of SoFi's vertical integration strategy, being potentially a key differentiator to other financial institutions that traditionally rely on several IT providers for back-to-front office applications.
    SoFi's goal is to create a better technological infrastructure that is able to integrate different products in one single platform, instead of, for example, having a system for credit cards and another completely different for investing products. This traditional architecture means that financial institutions can use dozens of different software to run their business, which are difficult to integrate and add complexity when managing a customer's total relationship with the financial institution.
    *Technisys Cyberbank platform* is a multi-product platform based on the cloud, which is already used by many banks, neobanks, fintechs and other financial institutions. By combining Cyberbank with Galileo, SoFi's goal is to have a digital banking platform that can be used by itself and its customers, in what SoFi calls the 'AWS of Fintech'.


## <h2> Landscape:

* SoFi cover the following domain:
    - Personal finance
    - Software
    - Banking
    - Insurance

* The major trends and innovations of all this domain over the last 5-10 years was digitalization that is the part of the fintech segment: offering apps, software and other technologies in the industry - all of this feature impacted traditional a, services, which usually have a significant physical presence through branches.


* Competitors:
    - Nubank
    - Avant
    - ZestMoney
    - Robinhood
    - Happy Money
    - LendUp


## <h2> Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? 
    - Personal finance
    - Software
    - Banking
    - Insurance

* For my opinion best metric to value is price-to-book ratio (compares a company's market value to its book value). Currently SoFi does not have profits and its business is more geared to the banking business. Current valuation only 1.3x book value.



## <h3> Recommendations

* If I were to advise the company the products, my suggestion will be online drug store niche with MCCPD collaboration.

* MCCPD is a very fast growing company and I believe it will replace traditional understanding of physical drug-store and price on the drugs.
